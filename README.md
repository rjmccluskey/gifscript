# GIFScript

## DBC P10 Project

### Goal:

- I want to create a chat app that allows users to send a short GIF of themselves with every message.
- This will invlove accessing the user's webcam to record the GIF each time the user wants to send a message.

### MVP:

- Since I do not know yet if I will get a working app with the above goals, my MVP will be to create a global chatroom with the ability to search for a GIF using an API, and then attach that GIF to the message.
- The next step is to allow users to take pictures of themselves with the webcam and send that.

### Additional features

- Users can store their favorite GIFs/messages
- Messages are ranked by how many times they are favorited
- Users can see the top messages
- Users can report offensive messages
- Users can create and join private chat rooms
- Users can send and recieve private messages
- more possible features coming soon...
